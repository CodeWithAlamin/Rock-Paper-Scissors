<!-- Brief -->
<p align="center">
Initially built with vanilla TypeScript, the Rock, Paper, Scissors game is now upgraded to React with TypeScript. This project showcases my focus on learning and practicing TypeScript fundamentals, both in a vanilla JavaScript environment and now through React.

## What I Learned

Through this project, I strengthened my understanding of TypeScript in both a vanilla JavaScript environment and from v2 in React with TypeScript. It allowed me to explore static typing, improve code clarity, and enforce safer coding practices.

## Future Upgrades

I plan to continue enhancing this project by incorporating **Framer Motion**. This will allow me to practice and learn animation techniques for smoother, more interactive user experiences, further improving the UI and making the game more engaging.
